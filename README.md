# Aadhaar-Verification-UiPath

## Introduction:<br>
Aadhaar Verification is a method that uses the Aadhaar number, a unique 
identifying number issued by the Indian government, to verify an individual's 
identity. The process involves comparing an individual's biometric and 
demographic data to the data held in the Aadhaar database. Aadhaar Verification is 
necessary in India for a variety of government and private services, including 
opening bank accounts, registering for passports, and participating in welfare 
programs.<br>
The process of Aadhaar Verification can be time-consuming and error-prone when 
performed manually. The manual process involves a lot of paperwork and manual 
data entry, which increases the chances of errors and delays. Therefore, we propose 
a project to automate Aadhaar Verification using UiPath, a Robotic Process 
Automation (RPA) tool.
